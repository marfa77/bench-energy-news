        <h1>Western Australia extends subsidies for Ewington thermal coal mine to 2031 | Enerdata</h1>
<div class="callout">AI Summary: On January 22, 2026, it was reported that the State Government of Western Australia has agreed to extend a State Agreement and a subsidy to Griffin Coal, a private company that owns and operate the Ewington Mine in the Collie Basin by 5 years until 2031. Griffin Coal mines around 2.9 Mt/year, supplying most notably the Bluewaters coal-fired plant (434 MW) as well as industrial customers. Since 2022, Western Australia has provided AUD308m (USD209m) in support to Griffin Coal.</div>
<hr />
<h2>Web Version</h2>
<p>The State Government of Western Australia has announced a significant extension of financial support for Griffin Coal, prolonging the State Agreement and subsidies for the Ewington Mine in the Collie Basin until 2031.</p>
<h2>Key Details</h2>
<li>Total subsidy amount: AUD308m (USD209m)</li>
<li>Annual coal production: 2.9 Million tonnes</li>
<li>Primary customer: Bluewaters coal-fired power plant (434 MW)</li>
<h3>Significance of the Extension</h3>
<p>The extension represents a strategic move to support regional energy infrastructure and maintain employment in Western Australia's coal sector, despite growing global pressure for decarbonization.</p>
<h3>Bench Energy Expert View</h3>
<p>What this means: The subsidy extension signals Western Australia's commitment to managing a gradual energy transition while protecting regional economic interests.</p>
<p>Market impact: Continued stability for thermal coal supply in Western Australia</p>
<li>Price implications: Potential short-term price stabilization in regional coal markets</li>
<li>Supply chain effects: Sustained operations for Bluewaters power plant</li>
<li>Regional dynamics: Continued support for Collie Basin coal industry</li>
<p>Risks & Opportunities: While supporting immediate energy needs, the extension may create long-term challenges in aligning with global decarbonization targets.</p>
