        <h1>MYSTEEL: China's coking coal market to see mild recovery in 2026 - alcircle</h1>
<div class="callout">AI Summary: Mysteel's latest annual report predicts a rebalancing of China's coking coal market in 2026, influenced by supportive and restrictive policies. While these forces may increase coking coal prices, a sustained uptrend is unlikely due to overcapacity and uncertain demand. The price of Anze low-sulfur primary coking coal from Shanxi province is projected to range between Yuan 1,400-1,450 per tonne (USD 201-208 per tonne) EXW with VAT, a roughly 2% year-on-year increase. The highest level for the gra</div>

<h2>Web Version</h2>
<p>Mysteel's 2026 report indicates a mild recovery in China's coking coal market, with prices expected to range between Yuan 1,400-1,450 per tonne, driven by complex policy interactions and constrained by structural market overcapacity.</p>
<h2>Market Context: China's Coking Coal Landscape</h2>
<p>The Chinese coking coal market represents a critical intersection of industrial policy, infrastructure development, and global commodity dynamics. Mysteel's comprehensive annual report provides nuanced insights into the anticipated market trajectory for 2026, revealing a complex interplay of supportive and restrictive policy mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Price Projection Methodology</h2>
<p>Analysts have developed a granular pricing model focusing on Anze low-sulfur primary coking coal from Shanxi province. The projected price range of Yuan 1,400-1,450 (approximately USD 201-208) per tonne represents a modest 2% year-on-year increase, with potential peak pricing reaching Yuan 1,800 per tonne.</p>
<h2>Quarterly Market Segmentation</h2>
<li>Q1 2026: Characterized by continued market pressure and sluggish demand</li>
<li>Q2 2026: Anticipated modest rebound driven by construction sector resumption</li>
<li>H2 2026: Expected frequent volatility from mixed policy interventions</li>
<h2>Structural Market Constraints</h2>
<p>Despite potential recovery signals, significant structural constraints persist. Overcapacity remains a fundamental challenge, preventing sustained price increases. The market's ability to achieve meaningful price appreciation is fundamentally limited by existing production capabilities and uncertain demand elasticity.</p>
<h3>🧭 Bench Energy Expert View</h3>
<p>Market Interpretation: The 2026 coking coal market represents a delicate balancing act between policy-driven interventions and underlying structural market realities. Our analysis suggests that while short-term price movements will be notable, long-term market transformation remains constrained by systemic overcapacity.</p>
<li>Price Dynamics: Expect nuanced, policy-responsive pricing with limited sustained upward momentum</li>
<li>Regional Impacts: Shanxi province will remain the primary pricing benchmark, with potential spillover effects into Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi regions</li>
<li>Trading Strategies: Prioritize agile, short-cycle trading approaches over long-term speculative positions</li>
<li>Risk Mitigation: Closely monitor infrastructure investment rates and steel production indicators as leading market signals</li>
<p>Conclusion: The 2026 coking coal market demands sophisticated, data-driven approach, recognizing both cyclical opportunities and structural limitations.</p>
