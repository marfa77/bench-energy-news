<div class="callout">AI Summary: Heavy rainfall in northeast Australia has triggered floods that are hampering mine operations and disrupting supplies of metallurgical coal in the region. Some coal miners have declared force majeure on portions of their shipments or warned customers of potential delays. Argus Media reported that the road and rail disruptions had limited Glencore's ability to supply copper concentrate for multiple days.</div>
