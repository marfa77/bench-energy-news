<div class="callout">AI Summary: A new report from German non-profit Urgewald indicates that proposed metallurgical coal projects could increase global capacity by 52% this decade, even with an expected decline in demand. The group's '2026 Metallurgical Coal Exit List' tracks 145 parent companies and over 200 subsidiaries involved in new met coal mine development or expansions. Urgewald identified 273 projects planned or under construction across more than 20 countries, representing about 580 million tonnes a year of potential </div>

<h2>Web Version</h2>
<p>A comprehensive analysis reveals metallurgical coal projects are expanding globally, with 273 new developments potentially adding 580 million tonnes of annual capacity, despite projected demand decline and energy transition pressures.</p>
<h2>Global Metallurgical Coal Landscape: 2024-2030 Overview</h2>
<p>The global metallurgical coal sector is experiencing a complex transformation, characterized by simultaneous expansion and anticipated demand reduction. The latest report from German non-profit Urgewald provides unprecedented insights into this nuanced market dynamic.</p>
<h3>Project Pipeline Breakdown</h3>
<li>Total new projects: 273 across 20+ countries</li>
<li>Potential new capacity: 580 million tonnes/year</li>
<li>Parent companies tracked: 145</li>
<li>Subsidiary companies involved: 200+</li>
<h3>Demand Trajectory</h3>
<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts a significant demand shift:
2024 Demand: 1,114 million tonnes
2030 Projected Demand: 1,061 million tonnes
Expected Decline: Approximately 53 million tonnes annually</p>
<h3>Regional Focus: Queensland's Met Coal Hub</h3>
<p>Queensland, Australia emerges as a critical metallurgical coal development center. The Moranbah South project in the Bowen Basin represents a pivotal development, backed by industry giants Anglo American and Exxaro Resources, with a planned capacity of 18 million tonnes annually.</p>
<h3>Market Implications</h3>
<p>The continued project expansion, despite projected demand decline, signals complex market dynamics. Factors driving this trend include:

Existing infrastructure investments
Long-term steel production commitments
Regional economic dependencies
Technological transition challenges</p>
