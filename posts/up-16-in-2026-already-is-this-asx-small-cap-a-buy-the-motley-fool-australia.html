        <h1>Up 16% in 2026 already - is this ASX small-cap a buy? - The Motley Fool Australia</h1>
<div class="callout">AI Summary: Coronado Global Resources Inc (ASX: CRN) has seen its share price rise from $0.36 to $0.42 since the start of 2026, a rise of more than 16%, driven by a rebound in metallurgical coal prices to around US$230/t, which is up sharply over the past month and more than 16% higher year-on-year. Bell Potter has upgraded its near-term coal price outlook, expecting hard coking coal to average US$220/t in 2026 (up from US$190) and thermal coal to reach US$110/t in 2026 (up from US$100).</div>

<h2>Web Version</h2>
<p>The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is witnessing a notable performance from Coronado Global Resources (CRN), with its share price surging from $0.36 to $0.42 in early 2026—a remarkable 16% increase driven by robust metallurgical coal prices.</p>
<h2>Market Dynamics</h2>
<li>Metallurgical coal prices rebounded to US$230/t</li>
<li>Year-on-year growth exceeding 16%</li>
<li>Bell Potter upgrades near-term coal price outlook</li>
<h3>Price Forecasts</h3>
<h3>Bench Energy Expert View</h3>
<p>What this means: The coal market is experiencing a strategic realignment, with Australian producers like Coronado positioned to capitalize on rising global demand and price resilience.</p>
<p>Market Impact: Expect continued volatility with potential upside for metallurgical coal producers, particularly those with flexible export capabilities.</p>
<li>Price Implications: Potential for sustained prices above US$220/t for hard coking coal</li>
<li>Supply Chain Effects: Increased focus on Australian coal export infrastructure</li>
<li>Regional Dynamics: Strong demand from Asian steel manufacturing sectors</li>
<p>Risks & Opportunities: While the outlook appears positive, investors should monitor geopolitical tensions and ongoing energy transition pressures.</p>
