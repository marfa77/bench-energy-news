        <h1>Coking coal upside seen by UBS as prices hit year's high - Indonesian Mining Association</h1>
<div class="callout">AI Summary: UBS has upgraded its 2026 benchmark price forecast for premium low vol coking coal by 17% to $235 per tonne, citing ongoing supply disruptions and strong demand from India. Spot prices for steelmaking coal have increased by over 15% since early December to above $230/t, their highest in 12 months, driven by wet weather and operational issues in Australia and Canada. UBS now sees spot prices peaking near $250/t in the first quarter before easing to around $220/t in 2027.</div>

<h2>Web Version</h2>
<p>The global metallurgical coal market is experiencing a transformative period, with UBS revising its price forecasts and signaling strong market potential through 2027.</p>
<h2>Market Dynamics</h2>
<p>UBS has upgraded its benchmark price forecast for premium low volatility coking coal by 17%, now projecting $235 per tonne by 2026. This revision comes amid notable market developments:</p>
<li>Spot prices increasing over 15% since early December</li>
<li>Current prices exceeding $230 per tonne</li>
<li>Significant supply disruptions in key producing regions</li>
<h3>Supply and Demand Drivers</h3>

<li>Persistent wet weather in Australia and Canada</li>
<li>Operational challenges in major coal-producing regions</li>
<li>Strong demand surge from Indian steel manufacturers</li>
<h3>Bench Energy Expert View</h3>
<p>What this means: The coking coal market is experiencing a structural shift with supply constraints creating significant price support.</p>
<p>Market impact: Expect volatility in Q1 2024 with prices potentially peaking near $250/t before gradual normalization.</p>
<li>Price implications: Higher costs for steel producers</li>
<li>Supply chain effects: Increased logistics complexity</li>
<li>Regional dynamics: Strong Indian and Asian demand</li>
<p>Risks & Opportunities: Potential for further price escalation if Australian and Canadian production remains constrained.</p>
