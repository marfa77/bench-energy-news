        <h1>Why India's coal revival looks impossible to achieve - The Economic Times</h1>
<div class="callout">AI Summary: According to The Economic Times on January 22, 2026, the International Energy Agency predicts China will lose 180 million tons of coal demand through 2030, while India's consumption will rise by about 200 million tons through 2030; the Indian government is promising to build 97 gigawatts of additional coal power by 2035, nearly 50% more than is currently in place.</div>
<hr />
<h2>Web Version</h2>
<p>The International Energy Agency's latest report presents a complex picture of India's coal sector, highlighting significant strategic challenges in the country's energy transition.</p>
<h2>Key Projections</h2>
<li>China expected to lose 180 million tons of coal demand by 2030</li>
<li>India planning to increase coal consumption by approximately 200 million tons</li>
<li>Government proposing 97 gigawatts of additional coal power by 2035</li>
<h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
<p>India's coal strategy appears increasingly at odds with global decarbonization trends, raising questions about long-term economic and environmental sustainability.</p>
<h3>Bench Energy Expert View</h3>
<p>What this means: India's coal expansion represents a high-risk strategy that may create significant economic and environmental challenges in the medium to long term.</p>
<p>Market Impact: Potential consequences include:</p>
<li>Increased risk of stranded assets in coal infrastructure</li>
<li>Growing investment uncertainty in traditional energy sectors</li>
<li>Potential competitive disadvantage compared to renewable energy investments</li>
<p>Risks & Opportunities: The strategy presents significant risks, including potential economic inefficiencies and missed opportunities in renewable energy development.</p>
