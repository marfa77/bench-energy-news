<h1>Coal Power Generation Falls in China and India: A Historic Energy Transition</h1>

<h2>Market Transformation Signals</h2>
<p>For the first time since the 1970s, coal power generation has declined in two of the world's most significant energy markets—China and India. This watershed moment reflects a dramatic shift towards renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Detailed Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
<li>China's Coal Power Generation: -1.6%</li>
<li>India's Coal Power Generation: -3%</li>
<li>China's New Renewable Capacity:
    <ul>
        <li>Solar Power: 300 GW</li>
        <li>Wind Power: 100 GW</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>India's New Renewable Capacity:
    <ul>
        <li>Solar Power: 35 GW</li>
        <li>Wind Power: 6 GW</li>
        <li>Hydropower: 3.5 GW</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Market Implications</h2>
<p>This decline represents more than a statistical anomaly—it signals a fundamental restructuring of global energy production, with renewable technologies rapidly becoming mainstream power generation sources.</p>

<blockquote>The energy transition is no longer theoretical; it's happening in real-time across major emerging economies.</blockquote>
