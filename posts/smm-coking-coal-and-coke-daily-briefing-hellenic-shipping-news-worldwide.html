        <h1>SMM Coking Coal and Coke Daily Briefing | Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide</h1>
<div class="callout">AI Summary: Coking plants are generally experiencing losses, leading some to prepare for production cuts, which is expected to tighten coke supply. End-use demand for finished steel remains weak, limiting hot metal output growth at steel mills. Steel mills are cautious in their coke purchasing, maintaining medium to high inventory levels and purchasing as needed. The low-sulphur coking coal offer in Linfen was 1,650 yuan/mt, while in Tangshan, it was 1,450 yuan/mt. The nationwide average price for first-gra</div>

<h2>Web Version</h2>
<p>The Chinese coal and coke market is experiencing significant production challenges, with coking plants facing losses and preparing potential production cuts, while steel mill demand remains weak and purchasing strategies remain cautious.</p>
<h2>Market Context: Coking Coal and Coke Dynamics</h2>
<p>The current coal and coke market in China represents a complex ecosystem of interconnected industrial challenges. Coking plants are confronting substantial financial pressures, primarily driven by reduced steel demand and challenging pricing environments.</p>
<h3>Production Landscape</h3>
<p>Current market indicators suggest a nuanced production scenario where coking plants are strategically preparing for potential production reductions. This anticipatory approach stems from persistent financial losses and the need to maintain operational efficiency in a challenging market.</p>
<h3>Price Variations by Region</h3>
<li>Linfen low-sulphur coking coal: 1,650 yuan/mt</li>
<li>Tangshan low-sulphur coking coal: 1,450 yuan/mt</li>
<li>First-grade metallurgical coke (dry quenching): 1,735 yuan/mt</li>
<li>Quasi-first-grade metallurgical coke (dry quenching): 1,595 yuan/mt</li>
<li>First-grade metallurgical coke (wet quenching): 1,390 yuan/mt</li>
<li>Quasi-first-grade metallurgical coke (wet quenching): 1,300 yuan/mt</li>
<h3>Steel Sector Implications</h3>
<p>The current market demonstrates significant restraint in steel production. End-use demand for finished steel remains subdued, directly impacting hot metal output growth. Steel mills are adopting a conservative purchasing strategy, maintaining medium to high inventory levels and purchasing materials on an as-needed basis.</p>
<h2>🧭 Bench Energy Expert View</h2>
<p>The current coal and coke market represents a critical inflection point in China's industrial ecosystem. Production cuts are not merely a reactive measure but a strategic recalibration in response to complex market dynamics.</p>
<p>Key observations include:</p>
<li>Potential market tightening due to strategic production reductions</li>
<li>Continued weakness in steel sector demand</li>
<li>Regional price disparities indicating localized market complexities</li>
<li>Inventory management as a critical risk mitigation strategy</li>
<p>Traders and industry stakeholders should closely monitor regional price variations, inventory levels, and potential supply chain disruptions. The next 6-12 months will be crucial in determining whether these production cuts translate into meaningful market stabilization or further volatility.</p>
