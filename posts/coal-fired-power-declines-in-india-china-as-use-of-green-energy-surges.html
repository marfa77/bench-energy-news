<p>Coal Power Decline: Asia's Green Energy Revolution


Historic Shift: Coal Power Generation Declines in China and India</p>
<p>For the first time since the 1970s, coal-fired power generation has decreased in both China and India, signaling a significant transformation in the region's energy landscape.</p>
<p>Key Statistics

China: 1.6% reduction in coal power generation
India: 3% decline in thermal power


Renewable Energy Surge</p>
<p>India's impressive renewable energy additions include:</p>
<p>35 GW of solar power
6 GW of wind power
3.5 GW of hydropower


"This marks a critical turning point in Asia's energy transition."

Market Implications</p>
<p>The declining coal power generation suggests a long-term structural shift towards cleaner, more sustainable energy sources.</p>
